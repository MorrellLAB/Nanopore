# SQK-RAD004 Protocol

The protocol can be modified in the markdown file called `SQK-RAD004-protocol.md`.

The printable PDF version of the protocol is the file called [`SQK-RAD004-protocol.pdf`](https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Nanopore/blob/master/SQK-RAD004/SQK-RAD004-protocol.pdf). See below for how to convert the markdown file to PDF.

**If additional edits are made** to the `SQK-RAD004-protocol.md` file, use the Chrome extension [GitHub Markdown Printer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-markdown-printer/fehpdlpmcegfpbkgcnaleindodeegapk?hl=en) to convert markdown to PDF. The resulting PDF will appear exactly as you see on GitHub.

Next, follow these instructions to generate an updated PDF:

1. Navigate to the GitHub webpage for the markdown file: https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Nanopore/blob/master/SQK-RAD004/SQK-RAD004-protocol.md and click on the GitHub Markdown Printer extension and a print window should pop up.
2. From here, click "Save as PDF", rename the file to `SQK-RAD004-protocol.pdf`, and save to the subdirectory [`Nanopore/SQK-RAD004`](https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Nanopore/tree/master/SQK-RAD004).
3. Then add, commit, and push the updated PDF to GitHub.

The resulting PDF is available here for downloading and printing: https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Nanopore/blob/master/SQK-RAD004/SQK-RAD004-protocol.pdf

This is a little bit of a "manual" process, but since these protocols don't get updated very often the time tradeoff is reasonable.
